- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 19
- Vite
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS 4

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express 5
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- CORS
- dotenv
- Faker.js (for seeding data)

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
cd lead-mangement-system
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

**To get your MongoDB URI:**
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a free cluster
3. Click "Connect" → "Connect your application"
4. Copy the connection string
5. Replace `<password>` with your database user password

### 3. Seed the Database

```bash
cd backend
node seed/seedLeads.js
```

This will populate your database with 500 dummy leads.

### 4. Start the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### 5. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd lead-dashboard
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `lead-dashboard` directory:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 6. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd lead-dashboard
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

## 🧪 Testing the Application

1. **Health Check**: 
   ```
   GET http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

2. **Test API with Postman/Thunder Client**:
   - Import the endpoints above
   - Test different query combinations

3. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Login with demo credentials
   - Navigate through all pages
   - Test filters, search, and pagination
   - View individual lead details
   - Test on mobile viewport

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**MongoDB Connection Error:**
- Verify your `MONGO_URI` is correct
- Check if your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Ensure database user has proper permissions

### Frontend Issues

**API Connection Error:**
- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env`
- Ensure CORS is properly configured

**Build Errors:**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 📝 Notes

- This uses basic authentication for demonstration purposes. In production, implement proper JWT-based authentication.
- The seeding script will delete all existing leads before adding new ones.
- MongoDB Atlas free tier has a 512MB storage limit.
- Free tier hosting services may have cold starts (initial load might be slow).
